## U

**unchecked exception**  
An exception that does not require explicit handling.  
*Analogy: Like a surprise pop quiz - it can happen anytime without warning.*

**Unchecked exception**  
An exception that is not checked at compile-time and usually results from programming errors.

*Analogy: Like a labeled jar where you store something and can find it later by reading the label.*

**void**  
A return type indicating a method does not return a value.
