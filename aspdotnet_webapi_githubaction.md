# GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline TODO Guide

## üèóÔ∏è Repository and Workflow Setup

### ‚úÖ Create `.github/workflows` directory structure
**Why**: GitHub Actions requires workflows to be in this specific directory to be recognized and executed.
**Intention**: Establish the foundation for automated CI/CD processes that trigger on code changes and deployments.

```
.github/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ci-build.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cd-deploy.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security-scan.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dependency-update.yml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment-template.yml
```

### ‚úÖ Define workflow triggers (push, pull_request, schedule, workflow_dispatch)
**Why**: Different triggers serve different purposes - push for CI, PR for validation, schedule for maintenance, manual for deployments.
**Intention**: Automate appropriate actions at the right times while maintaining control over when sensitive operations occur.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
    paths-ignore: ['**.md', 'docs/**']
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Environment to deploy to'
        required: true
        default: 'staging'
        type: choice
        options: [staging, production]
```

### ‚úÖ Configure workflow permissions and security
**Why**: Follows principle of least privilege to minimize security risks from compromised workflows or tokens.
**Intention**: Ensure workflows can only perform necessary actions while protecting sensitive resources and data.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: write
  security-events: write
  pull-requests: write
```

## üß™ Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

### ‚úÖ Set up .NET SDK and runtime versions matrix
**Why**: Tests across multiple .NET versions ensure compatibility and catch version-specific issues.
**Intention**: Maintain broad compatibility while catching breaking changes early in the development cycle.

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    dotnet-version: ['6.0.x', '8.0.x']
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
```

### ‚úÖ Configure code checkout with proper depth
**Why**: Shallow clones speed up checkout but may break tools that need full git history (like GitVersion).
**Intention**: Balance build speed with tooling requirements for versioning and change analysis.

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0  # Full history for GitVersion
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### ‚úÖ Implement caching for dependencies and build artifacts
**Why**: Caching NuGet packages, Docker layers, and build outputs significantly reduces build times and costs.
**Intention**: Optimize build performance and reduce infrastructure costs while maintaining reliability.

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.nuget/packages
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-nuget-${{ hashFiles('**/*.csproj') }}
    restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-nuget-
```

### ‚úÖ Configure automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)
**Why**: Different test types catch different classes of bugs - unit tests for logic, integration for service interactions.
**Intention**: Maintain code quality and prevent regressions through comprehensive automated testing.

```yaml
- name: Run Unit Tests
  run: dotnet test --configuration Release --logger trx --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
  
- name: Run Integration Tests
  run: docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit
```

### ‚úÖ Set up code quality analysis (SonarQube, CodeQL, ESLint)
**Why**: Static analysis catches security vulnerabilities, code smells, and maintainability issues before they reach production.
**Intention**: Maintain high code quality standards and identify security issues early in the development process.

```yaml
- name: Initialize CodeQL
  uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
  with:
    languages: csharp
    
- name: SonarCloud Scan
  uses: SonarSource/sonarcloud-github-action@master
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
```

### ‚úÖ Configure test coverage reporting and thresholds
**Why**: Coverage metrics help identify untested code paths and maintain testing discipline over time.
**Intention**: Ensure adequate test coverage while preventing coverage from degrading as the codebase evolves.

### ‚úÖ Implement dependency vulnerability scanning
**Why**: Third-party dependencies are common attack vectors - scanning catches known vulnerabilities before deployment.
**Intention**: Proactively address security vulnerabilities in dependencies before they can be exploited.

```yaml
- name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    scan-type: 'fs'
    scan-ref: '.'
    format: 'sarif'
    output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```

**Intention**: Optimize build performance while maintaining reproducible, reliable container builds.

```yaml
- name: Build Docker image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
  with:
    context: .
    platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

### ‚úÖ Configure container image security scanning
**Why**: Container images may contain vulnerabilities in base images or application dependencies.
**Intention**: Prevent vulnerable containers from reaching production while maintaining security visibility.

```yaml
- name: Run Snyk to check Docker image for vulnerabilities
  uses: snyk/actions/docker@master
  env:
    SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
  with:
    image: myapp:${{ github.sha }}
    args: --severity-threshold=high
```

### ‚úÖ Implement image signing and attestation (Sigstore/Cosign)
**Why**: Proves authenticity and integrity of container images, preventing supply chain attacks.
**Intention**: Establish trust chain for container images from build through deployment.

```yaml
- name: Sign container image
  uses: sigstore/cosign-installer@v3
  
- name: Sign image with Cosign
  run: cosign sign --yes ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }}
```

### ‚úÖ Configure registry authentication and image pushing
**Why**: Secure access to container registries while enabling automated image publishing.
**Intention**: Automate container distribution while maintaining security and access controls.

```yaml
- name: Login to Container Registry
  uses: docker/login-action@v2
  with:
    registry: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}
    username: ${{ github.actor }}
    password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### ‚úÖ Configure OIDC token authentication for cloud providers
**Why**: Eliminates need for long-lived credentials by using short-lived tokens issued by GitHub.
**Intention**: Improve security posture by using identity-based authentication instead of static credentials.

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
  
- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
  with:
    role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME }}
    aws-region: us-east-1
```

### ‚úÖ Set up branch protection rules and required checks
