# Docker Compose Microservices Orchestration TODO Guide

## 🏗️ Architecture Planning

### ✅ Define service boundaries and responsibilities
**Why**: Clear separation of concerns prevents tight coupling and enables independent scaling and deployment.
**Intention**: Create maintainable, scalable microservices that can evolve independently while working together as a cohesive system.

### ✅ Plan service communication patterns
**Why**: Determines network configuration, service discovery, and data flow between components.
**Intention**: Enable secure, efficient inter-service communication while maintaining loose coupling and fault tolerance.

### ✅ Design database strategy (per-service vs shared)
**Why**: Database-per-service pattern ensures data ownership and independence but requires careful transaction management.
**Intention**: Balance data consistency requirements with service autonomy and scalability needs.

### ✅ Choose API Gateway solution (Ocelot, YARP, nginx, Kong, etc.)
**Why**: Different gateways offer varying features like rate limiting, authentication, load balancing, and monitoring.
**Intention**: Provide a single entry point that handles cross-cutting concerns and shields internal services from external clients.
