# .NET Web API Dockerfile Workflow Guide

## üìã Pre-Development Setup

### ‚úÖ Verify .NET version (6.0, 7.0, 8.0, or 9.0)
**Why**: Different .NET versions have different base images, features, and security updates. Using the correct version ensures compatibility and access to the latest improvements.
**Intention**: Establish a solid foundation by matching your development environment with the container runtime environment.

### ‚úÖ Identify target runtime (linux-x64, linux-arm64, etc.)
**Why**: Runtime identifiers affect image size, performance, and compatibility with your deployment platform (AWS Graviton, Apple Silicon, etc.).
**Intention**: Optimize for your specific deployment architecture to reduce image size and improve performance.

### ‚úÖ Review project dependencies and NuGet packages
**Why**: Some packages may require additional system libraries, affect image size, or have security vulnerabilities.
**Intention**: Understand what will be included in your container to make informed decisions about base images and security scanning.

### ‚úÖ Create `.dockerignore` with .NET specific exclusions
**Why**: Prevents unnecessary files from being copied into the Docker context, reducing build time and image size.
**Intention**: Speed up builds and prevent sensitive development files from accidentally being included in the container.

### ‚úÖ Plan configuration management (appsettings, environment variables)
**Why**: Containers should be configured externally to follow the 12-factor app principles and enable deployment across different environments.
**Intention**: Enable flexible, secure configuration management that works across development, staging, and production.

## üìÅ .dockerignore Configuration

### ‚úÖ Add standard .NET exclusions
**Why**: Build artifacts (`bin/`, `obj/`), IDE files (`.vs/`, `.vscode/`), and version control files add unnecessary weight and potential security risks.
**Intention**: Create lean, secure images by excluding development-only files and build artifacts that will be regenerated inside the container.

**Example exclusions**:
```
**/bin       # Compiled binaries (will be rebuilt)
**/obj       # Build intermediates (will be regenerated)
**/.vs       # Visual Studio files (IDE-specific)
.git         # Version control (security risk)
TestResults  # Test outputs (not needed in production)
```

---

## üê≥ Dockerfile Development

### ‚úÖ Use official Microsoft base images
**Why**: Official images are regularly updated with security patches, optimized for .NET applications, and include necessary runtime components.
**Intention**: Leverage Microsoft's expertise in .NET containerization while ensuring security and compatibility.

```dockerfile
# Build stage - includes SDK for compilation
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
# Runtime stage - minimal image with only runtime components
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS runtime
```

### ‚úÖ Implement multi-stage build (build ‚Üí publish ‚Üí runtime)
**Why**: Separates build tools from runtime environment, dramatically reducing final image size and attack surface.
**Intention**: Create production-ready images that are secure, minimal, and optimized for deployment.

### ‚úÖ Copy `.csproj` files first for better layer caching
**Why**: Docker caches layers - if project files don't change, NuGet restore can be skipped, speeding up subsequent builds.
**Intention**: Optimize build times by leveraging Docker's layer caching mechanism effectively.

```dockerfile
# This layer is cached if .csproj files haven't changed
COPY *.csproj ./
RUN dotnet restore
# Source code changes won't invalidate the restore cache
COPY . ./
```

### ‚úÖ Set `EXPOSE 80` and `EXPOSE 443` (if HTTPS)
**Why**: Documents which ports the application uses and enables proper port mapping in orchestration platforms.
**Intention**: Make the container's network interface clear and enable proper service discovery and load balancing.

### ‚úÖ Configure non-root user: `USER app`
**Why**: Running as root violates security best practices and increases the blast radius of potential security breaches.
**Intention**: Follow the principle of least privilege to minimize security risks in production environments.

---

## üî® Build Configuration

### ‚úÖ Use Release configuration: `dotnet publish -c Release`
**Why**: Release builds are optimized for performance, have debug symbols removed, and use production-appropriate compiler optimizations.
**Intention**: Deploy performant, production-ready code without development artifacts.

### ‚úÖ Enable self-contained deployment if required: `--self-contained`
**Why**: Includes the .NET runtime in the application, eliminating dependency on runtime being pre-installed in the container.
**Intention**: Create completely self-contained applications that can run on minimal base images (like Alpine or distroless).

### ‚úÖ Consider ReadyToRun images: `-p:PublishReadyToRun=true`
**Why**: Pre-compiles IL to native code, improving startup time at the cost of larger image size.
**Intention**: Optimize cold start performance for applications where startup time is critical (serverless, auto-scaling scenarios).

---

## üöÄ Build and Test Phase

### ‚úÖ Build image: `docker build -t myapi:latest .`
**Why**: Validates that the Dockerfile works correctly and creates a testable artifact.
**Intention**: Create a reproducible build process that can be automated in CI/CD pipelines.

### ‚úÖ Run container locally: `docker run -p 8080:80 myapi:latest`
**Why**: Verifies the container runs correctly and the application starts as expected.
**Intention**: Catch runtime issues early in the development process before deployment.

### ‚úÖ Test API endpoints (health check, swagger, main endpoints)
**Why**: Ensures the application is accessible and functional within the containerized environment.
**Intention**: Validate that containerization hasn't broken application functionality or introduced networking issues.

### ‚úÖ Test graceful shutdown with `docker stop`
**Why**: Verifies the application handles SIGTERM signals properly and cleans up resources before termination.
**Intention**: Ensure data integrity and proper resource cleanup in orchestrated environments where containers are frequently stopped and started.

---

## üéØ .NET Specific Optimizations

### ‚úÖ Use trimming for smaller images: `-p:PublishTrimmed=true`
**Why**: Removes unused code and assemblies, significantly reducing image size and attack surface.
**Intention**: Create lean, efficient containers that deploy faster and use less storage and bandwidth.

### ‚úÖ Configure garbage collection for containers: `COMPlus_EnableDiagnostics=0`
**Why**: Disables diagnostic features that aren't needed in production and can improve performance and reduce memory usage.
**Intention**: Optimize runtime performance for containerized environments where debugging tools aren't needed.

### ‚úÖ Leverage NuGet package caching between builds
**Why**: Avoids re-downloading packages that haven't changed, significantly speeding up builds.
**Intention**: Improve developer productivity and reduce CI/CD build times.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management

### ‚úÖ Set `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable
**Why**: Controls which appsettings files are loaded and enables/disables development features like detailed error pages.
**Intention**: Enable environment-specific behavior while maintaining the same container image across environments.

### ‚úÖ Configure `ASPNETCORE_URLS` for port binding
**Why**: Controls which interfaces and ports the application listens on inside the container.
