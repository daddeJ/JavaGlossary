# Setting Up a Web API Project

## Introduction

This guide will help you set up a basic Web API using ASP.NET Core. We'll take it step-by-step, starting from installing the right tools to writing and testing your first API endpoint. This is meant for beginners who are just getting started with web development and only have Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed.

## What You'll Need Before You Begin

To follow this guide, you must install the following tools on your computer. If you haven't installed them yet, follow the instructions below:

### 1. .NET SDK

**What it is:** A set of tools and libraries to build .NET apps.

**Download here:** https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

**Installation tip:** Choose the latest LTS version of the .NET SDK (e.g., .NET 9 if available). Download the SDK not just the runtime.

**To verify installation:**
```bash
dotnet --version
```

### 2. Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

You should already have this installed. If not, get it from https://code.visualstudio.com/

### 3. C# Extension for VS Code

In VS Code:
- Go to the Extensions tab (left sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
- Search for "C#"
- Install the extension published by Microsoft

## Step-by-Step: Create Your First Web API

### Step 1: Create a New Project

Open your terminal in VS Code or your operating system and type:

```bash
dotnet new webapi -o MyFirstApi
cd MyFirstApi
```

This command:
- Creates a new folder called `MyFirstApi`
- Sets up a new Web API project using the minimal API style, which doesn't include controllers by default
- You'll see files like `Program.cs`, and possibly `WeatherForecast.cs` and `WeatherForecastController.cs` depending on your .NET version.

**Important:** The template does not include a Controllers folder by default. You'll need to create it.

### Step 2: Open the Project in VS Code

```bash
code .
```

This opens the current folder in VS Code.

If prompted, allow required assets to be added. These help with debugging and building the app.

### Step 3: Modify Program.cs to Support Controllers

By default, the minimal API template doesn't support controllers. To enable controller support:

1. Open the `Program.cs` file.
2. Replace its contents with the following:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddControllers();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
// Remove HTTPS redirection so you can test with http
// app.UseHttpsRedirection();

app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapControllers();

app.Run();
```

**Note:** We commented out `app.UseHttpsRedirection();` so you can test your API with `http://` instead of `https://`, which can sometimes be problematic in early development stages.

### Step 4: Create the Controllers Folder

1. Right-click the root of the project
2. Click **New Folder**
3. Name it `Controllers`

This is where you define controllers. Controllers manage the logic of your app and respond to HTTP requests.

### Step 5: Create Your Own Controller

Let's add a controller that returns a list of products.

1. Right-click the `Controllers` folder
2. Click **New File**
3. Name it `ProductsController.cs`
4. Paste this code into the file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace MyFirstApi.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public ActionResult<List<string>> Get()
        {
            return new List<string> { "Apple", "Banana", "Orange" };
        }
    }
}
```

**What this does:**
- Defines a route: `api/products`
- Handles GET requests to that route
- Returns a list of strings as product names

### Step 6: Run Your API

In the terminal, type:

```bash
dotnet run
```

You should see output like:
```
Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
```

**Note:** Your port number may be different. For example, instead of "5000" you may see a different number. Use the number that displays in your terminal instead of 5000.

Open a browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5000/api/products
```

You should see:
```json
["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
```

### Step 7: Understand Routing Basics

- `[HttpGet]` maps a method to an HTTP GET request
- `[Route("api/[controller]")]` means the route is based on the controller name (ProductsController â†’ products)

You can define custom routes too:

```csharp
[HttpGet("featured")]
public string GetFeaturedProduct() => "Mango";
```

Now available at:
```
http://localhost:5000/api/products/featured
```

### Step 8: Add More HTTP Methods

In your `ProductsController`, you can add methods for POST, PUT, and DELETE:

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult<string> Post([FromBody] string newProduct)
{
    return $"Added: {newProduct}";
}

[HttpPut("{id}")]
public ActionResult<string> Put(int id, [FromBody] string updatedProduct)
{
    return $"Updated product {id} to: {updatedProduct}";
}

[HttpDelete("{id}")]
public ActionResult<string> Delete(int id)
{
    return $"Deleted product with ID: {id}";
}
```

Use Postman to test these methods. You can install Postman from their website and use the free version here: https://www.postman.com/

### Step 9: Practice and Build

Now that you have a basic Web API:
- Try returning real data models (not just strings)
- Add validation and error handling
- Store and retrieve data using collections, files, or databases (future lessons will help)

## Conclusion

You've now built and tested a simple Web API using ASP.NET Core in VS Code. As you move forward, this setup becomes the foundation for more advanced features like authentication, databases, and real-world deployment.
