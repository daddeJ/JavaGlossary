# SQL Functions and Aggregate Functions: Data Transformation and Analysis

## Introduction
SQL functions are powerful tools that enable efficient data manipulation, transformation, and analysis. This comprehensive guide covers both scalar functions (which operate on individual values) and aggregate functions (which summarize data across multiple rows). These functions are essential for data professionals to transform raw data into meaningful insights and drive data-informed decisions.

## 1. Sample Database Setup

For this guide, we'll use an expanded e-commerce database:

```sql
-- Sample database schema
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    Phone VARCHAR(20),
    Department VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    HireDate DATE,
    City VARCHAR(50),
    Status VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100),
    Category VARCHAR(50),
    Price DECIMAL(10,2),
    StockQuantity INT,
    Description TEXT,
    CreatedDate DATE
);

CREATE TABLE Sales (
    SaleID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeID INT,
    ProductID INT,
    SaleDate DATE,
    Quantity INT,
    UnitPrice DECIMAL(10,2),
    Commission DECIMAL(8,2),
    FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employees(EmployeeID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID)
);

-- Sample data
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@company.com', '555-0123', 'Sales', 55000.00, '2023-01-15', 'New York', 'Active'),
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@company.com', '555-0124', 'Marketing', 62000.00, '2022-03-20', 'Los Angeles', 'Active'),
(3, 'Mike', 'Johnson', 'mike.j@company.com', '555-0125', 'Sales', 58000.00, '2023-06-01', 'Chicago', 'Active'),
(4, 'Sarah', 'Wilson', 'sarah.w@company.com', '555-0126', 'IT', 75000.00, '2021-09-10', 'Houston', 'Inactive');

INSERT INTO Products VALUES
(201, 'Wireless Headphones Pro', 'Electronics', 199.99, 50, 'High-quality wireless headphones with noise cancellation', '2023-01-01'),

## 2. Basic SQL Functions (Scalar Functions)

### String Functions

#### CONCAT - Combining Text Values

**Purpose**: Joins multiple text strings together to create formatted output.

```sql
-- Intention: Create full names for employee directory
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName,
    CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName, ' (', Department, ')') AS EmployeeWithDept,
    Email
FROM Employees
ORDER BY LastName;
```

```sql
-- Intention: Format product information for catalog
SELECT 
    ProductID,
    CONCAT(ProductName, ' - $', CAST(Price AS VARCHAR(10))) AS ProductListing,
    CONCAT(Category, ': ', ProductName) AS CategorizedName
FROM Products
ORDER BY Category;
```

```sql
-- Intention: Create formatted contact information
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName,
    CONCAT('Email: ', Email, ' | Phone: ', Phone) AS ContactInfo,
    CONCAT(City, ' - ', Department) AS LocationDept
FROM Employees
WHERE Status = 'Active';
```

#### LEN/LENGTH - Calculating Text Length

**Purpose**: Determines the character count in text fields for data validation and analysis.

```sql
-- Intention: Analyze product name lengths for display formatting
SELECT 
    ProductID,
    ProductName,
    LEN(ProductName) AS NameLength,
    CASE 
        WHEN LEN(ProductName) > 20 THEN 'Long Name'
        WHEN LEN(ProductName) > 10 THEN 'Medium Name'
        ELSE 'Short Name'
    END AS NameCategory
FROM Products
ORDER BY LEN(ProductName) DESC;
```

```sql
-- Intention: Validate email address format
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    Email,
    LEN(Email) AS EmailLength,
    CASE 
        WHEN LEN(Email) < 5 THEN 'Invalid - Too Short'
        WHEN Email NOT LIKE '%@%.%' THEN 'Invalid - Missing @ or Domain'
        ELSE 'Valid Format'
    END AS EmailValidation
FROM Employees;
```

#### UPPER and LOWER - Text Case Standardization

**Purpose**: Standardizes text case for consistent data presentation and comparison.

```sql
-- Intention: Standardize department names for reporting
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName,
    UPPER(Department) AS DepartmentUpper,
    LOWER(Email) AS EmailLower,
    UPPER(Status) AS StatusUpper
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Department;
```

```sql
-- Intention: Create standardized product categories
SELECT 
    ProductID,
    ProductName,
    UPPER(Category) AS StandardCategory,
    LOWER(SUBSTRING(Description, 1, 50)) AS DescriptionPreview
FROM Products
ORDER BY Category;
```

#### SUBSTRING - Text Extraction

**Purpose**: Extracts specific portions of text for analysis or formatting.

```sql
-- Intention: Extract area codes from phone numbers
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    Phone,
    SUBSTRING(Phone, 1, 3) AS AreaCode,
    SUBSTRING(Phone, 5, 8) AS PhoneNumber
FROM Employees
WHERE Phone IS NOT NULL;
```

```sql
-- Intention: Create product codes from names
SELECT 
    ProductID,
    ProductName,
    UPPER(SUBSTRING(ProductName, 1, 3)) AS ProductCode,
    SUBSTRING(Description, 1, 30) + '...' AS ShortDescription
FROM Products;
```

```sql
-- Intention: Extract year from hire date for analysis
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName,
    HireDate,
    SUBSTRING(CAST(HireDate AS VARCHAR), 1, 4) AS HireYear,
    Department
FROM Employees
ORDER BY HireDate;
```

## 3. Date and Numeric Functions

### Date Functions

```sql
-- Intention: Calculate employee tenure and service milestones
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName,
    HireDate,
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) AS YearsOfService,
    DATEDIFF(MONTH, HireDate, GETDATE()) AS MonthsOfService,
    CASE 
        WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) >= 5 THEN 'Senior Employee'
        WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) >= 2 THEN 'Experienced'
        ELSE 'New Employee'
    END AS ServiceLevel
FROM Employees
ORDER BY HireDate;
```

### Numeric Functions

```sql
-- Intention: Price analysis with rounding and formatting
SELECT 
    ProductID,
    ProductName,
    Price,
    ROUND(Price, 0) AS RoundedPrice,
    CEILING(Price) AS PriceCeiling,
    FLOOR(Price) AS PriceFloor,
    ABS(Price - 200) AS DifferenceFrom200
FROM Products
ORDER BY Price DESC;
```

---

## 4. Aggregate Functions for Data Summarization

### COUNT - Counting Records

**Purpose**: Determines the number of rows meeting specific conditions.

```sql
-- Intention: Employee count by department and status
SELECT 
    Department,
    Status,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
    COUNT(DISTINCT Status) AS UniqueStatuses
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department, Status
ORDER BY Department, Status;
```

```sql
-- Intention: Sales activity analysis
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    COUNT(SaleID) AS TotalSales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ProductID) AS UniqueProductsSold,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN SaleDate >= '2024-02-01' THEN 1 END) AS RecentSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY EmployeeID
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

```sql
-- Intention: Product inventory status
SELECT 
    Category,
    COUNT(*) AS TotalProducts,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN StockQuantity > 0 THEN 1 END) AS InStockProducts,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN StockQuantity = 0 THEN 1 END) AS OutOfStockProducts
FROM Products
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY Category;
```

### SUM - Calculating Totals

**Purpose**: Adds up numeric values across multiple rows.

```sql
-- Intention: Sales revenue analysis by employee

    e.EmployeeID,
    CONCAT(e.FirstName, ' ', e.LastName) AS EmployeeName,
    e.Department,
    SUM(s.Quantity * s.UnitPrice) AS TotalSalesRevenue,
    SUM(s.Commission) AS TotalCommission,
    SUM(s.Quantity) AS TotalUnitsSold
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Sales s ON e.EmployeeID = s.EmployeeID
GROUP BY e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, e.Department
ORDER BY TotalSalesRevenue DESC;
```

```sql
-- Intention: Monthly sales performance
SELECT 
    YEAR(SaleDate) AS SalesYear,
    MONTH(SaleDate) AS SalesMonth,
    SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS MonthlyRevenue,
    SUM(Quantity) AS MonthlyUnitsSold,
    SUM(Commission) AS MonthlyCommissions
FROM Sales
GROUP BY YEAR(SaleDate), MONTH(SaleDate)
ORDER BY SalesYear, SalesMonth;
```

### AVG - Calculating Averages

    AVG(StockQuantity) AS AverageStock,
    ROUND(AVG(LEN(ProductName)), 1) AS AvgNameLength
FROM Products
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY AveragePrice DESC;
```

### MIN and MAX - Finding Extremes

**Purpose**: Identifies the smallest and largest values to highlight trends and outliers.

```sql
-- Intention: Sales performance ranges by employee
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    CONCAT(e.FirstName, ' ', e.LastName) AS EmployeeName,
    COUNT(s.SaleID) AS TotalSales,
    MIN(s.Quantity * s.UnitPrice) AS SmallestSale,
    MAX(s.Quantity * s.UnitPrice) AS LargestSale,
    AVG(s.Quantity * s.UnitPrice) AS AverageSale,
    MIN(s.SaleDate) AS FirstSale,
    MAX(s.SaleDate) AS LastSale
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Sales s ON e.EmployeeID = s.EmployeeID
GROUP BY e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
ORDER BY LargestSale DESC;
```

```sql
-- Intention: Product inventory analysis
SELECT 
    Category,
    COUNT(*) AS ProductCount,
    MIN(Price) AS LowestPrice,
    MAX(Price) AS HighestPrice,
    MIN(StockQuantity) AS LowestStock,
    MAX(StockQuantity) AS HighestStock,
    MAX(Price) - MIN(Price) AS PriceRange
FROM Products
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY PriceRange DESC;
```

## 5. Advanced Aggregate Functions and Techniques

### GROUP BY with Multiple Columns

```sql
-- Intention: Comprehensive sales analysis by department and time period
SELECT 
    e.Department,
    YEAR(s.SaleDate) AS SalesYear,
    MONTH(s.SaleDate) AS SalesMonth,
    COUNT(s.SaleID) AS TotalSales,
    SUM(s.Quantity * s.UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue,
    AVG(s.Quantity * s.UnitPrice) AS AvgSaleValue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.EmployeeID) AS ActiveSalespeople,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.ProductID) AS UniqueProductsSold
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Sales s ON e.EmployeeID = s.EmployeeID
WHERE e.Status = 'Active'
GROUP BY e.Department, YEAR(s.SaleDate), MONTH(s.SaleDate)
ORDER BY e.Department, SalesYear, SalesMonth;
```

### HAVING Clause for Filtering Aggregated Data

```sql
-- Intention: Find high-performing employees (more than 2 sales)

    Category,
    COUNT(*) AS ProductCount,
    AVG(Price) AS AveragePrice,
    SUM(StockQuantity) AS TotalStock
FROM Products
GROUP BY Category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 AND AVG(Price) > 50
ORDER BY ProductCount DESC, AveragePrice DESC;
```

### Window Functions (Advanced Aggregation)

    s.SaleID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    s.SaleDate,
    s.Quantity * s.UnitPrice AS SaleAmount,
    
    -- Ranking functions
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY s.Quantity * s.UnitPrice DESC) AS SaleRank,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY e.EmployeeID ORDER BY s.Quantity * s.UnitPrice DESC) AS EmployeeSaleRank,
    
    -- Running calculations
    SUM(s.Quantity * s.UnitPrice) OVER (ORDER BY s.SaleDate) AS RunningTotal,
    AVG(s.Quantity * s.UnitPrice) OVER (PARTITION BY e.EmployeeID) AS EmployeeAvgSale
    
FROM Sales s

    -- Status validation
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Status NOT IN ('Active', 'Inactive') THEN 1 END) AS InvalidStatuses,
    
    -- Overall health score
    ROUND(
        (COUNT(*) - COUNT(CASE WHEN Email NOT LIKE '%@%.%' OR LEN(FirstName) < 2 OR Salary <= 0 THEN 1 END)) * 100.0 / COUNT(*),
        2
    ) AS DataQualityScore
    
FROM Employees;
```

### Performance Optimization Tips
