# Introduction to SQL Performance Tuning

## Introduction

This reference guide outlines core techniques for optimizing SQL queries to enhance database performance and efficiency. Performance tuning is essential for maintaining responsive applications, reducing server costs, and ensuring scalable database operations as data volumes grow.

## Key Techniques

### Query Optimization

#### Intent
Analyze and restructure SQL queries to minimize execution time through improved syntax, logical flow, and resource utilization.

#### Core Strategies

**1. Use Efficient WHERE Clauses**
```sql
-- INEFFICIENT: Function on column prevents index usage
SELECT customer_id, name, order_date
FROM orders
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2024;

-- EFFICIENT: Preserve index usage with range conditions
SELECT customer_id, name, order_date
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' 
  AND order_date < '2025-01-01';
```

**2. Optimize JOIN Operations**
```sql
-- INEFFICIENT: Multiple table scans
SELECT c.name, o.order_date, p.product_name
FROM customers c, orders o, order_items oi, products p
WHERE c.customer_id = o.customer_id
  AND o.order_id = oi.order_id
  AND oi.product_id = p.product_id
  AND c.region = 'North America';

-- EFFICIENT: Proper JOIN syntax with early filtering
SELECT c.name, o.order_date, p.product_name
FROM customers c
  INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
  INNER JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
  INNER JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE c.region = 'North America';
```

**3. Eliminate Unnecessary Columns**
```sql
-- INEFFICIENT: Selecting all columns
SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE status = 'active';

-- EFFICIENT: Select only needed columns
SELECT id, name, email, created_date 
FROM large_table 
WHERE status = 'active';
```

**4. Use EXISTS Instead of IN for Subqueries**
```sql
-- POTENTIALLY INEFFICIENT: IN with large subquery
SELECT customer_id, name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
);

-- MORE EFFICIENT: EXISTS stops at first match
SELECT customer_id, name
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o 
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id 
      AND o.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
);
```

### Indexing

#### Intent
Strategically implement indexes to accelerate data retrieval while maintaining optimal write performance and storage efficiency.

#### Index Types and Usage

**1. Single Column Indexes**
```sql
-- Create index on frequently filtered column
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_region ON customers(region);

-- Query that benefits from the index
SELECT customer_id, name FROM customers WHERE region = 'Europe';
```

**2. Composite Indexes**
```sql
-- Create composite index for multi-column filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status_date ON orders(status, order_date);

-- Queries that benefit from composite index
SELECT order_id FROM orders 
WHERE status = 'shipped' AND order_date >= '2024-01-01';

-- Index can also support single column queries (leftmost prefix)
SELECT order_id FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending';
```

**3. Covering Indexes**
```sql
-- Create covering index that includes all needed columns
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_covering 
ON orders(customer_id, order_date) 
INCLUDE (total_amount, status);

-- Query can be satisfied entirely from the index
SELECT customer_id, order_date, total_amount, status
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = 123 AND order_date >= '2024-01-01';
```

**4. Index Maintenance Considerations**
```sql
-- Monitor index usage
SELECT 
    table_name,
    index_name,
    seq_in_index,
    column_name,
    cardinality
FROM information_schema.statistics
WHERE table_schema = 'your_database'
ORDER BY table_name, index_name, seq_in_index;

-- Example: Remove unused index
-- DROP INDEX idx_unused_column ON table_name;
```

### Execution Plans

#### Intent
Analyze how the database engine processes queries to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

#### Reading and Interpreting Execution Plans

**1. Basic Execution Plan Analysis**
```sql
-- Generate execution plan (MySQL)
EXPLAIN SELECT c.name, COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.region = 'North America'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name;

-- Extended execution plan with cost information
EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON SELECT c.name, COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.region = 'North America'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name;
```

**2. Identifying Common Performance Issues**
```sql
-- Example query with potential issues
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE o.total_amount > 1000
ORDER BY o.order_date DESC;

/*
Look for these warning signs in execution plans:
- Table scan (type: ALL) instead of index usage
- High row counts being examined
- Filesort operations
- Using temporary tables
- Using where with large row counts
*/
```

**3. Optimizing Based on Execution Plan**
```sql
-- Before optimization: Full table scan
SELECT order_id, total_amount 
FROM orders 
WHERE total_amount BETWEEN 100 AND 500
ORDER BY order_date DESC;

-- Create supporting indexes based on execution plan analysis
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_amount_date ON orders(total_amount, order_date DESC);

-- After optimization: Index range scan
SELECT order_id, total_amount 
FROM orders 
WHERE total_amount BETWEEN 100 AND 500
ORDER BY order_date DESC;
```

### Database Statistics

#### Intent
Maintain accurate metadata about data distribution to help the query optimizer make informed decisions about execution strategies.

#### Statistics Management

**1. Updating Table Statistics**
```sql
-- MySQL: Update table statistics
ANALYZE TABLE customers, orders, products;

-- Check table statistics
SELECT 
    table_name,
    table_rows,
    avg_row_length,
    data_length,
    index_length,
    update_time
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'your_database';
```

**2. Column Statistics and Cardinality**
```sql
-- Check column cardinality for index effectiveness
SELECT 
    table_name,
    column_name,
    cardinality,
    sub_part,
    nullable
FROM information_schema.statistics
WHERE table_schema = 'your_database'
  AND table_name = 'customers';

-- Manually update statistics for specific table
ANALYZE TABLE orders UPDATE HISTOGRAM ON order_date, total_amount;
```

**3. Automated Statistics Maintenance**
```sql
-- Example stored procedure for regular statistics updates
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateDatabaseStatistics()
BEGIN
    DECLARE done INT DEFAULT FALSE;
    DECLARE table_name VARCHAR(255);
    DECLARE table_cursor CURSOR FOR 
        SELECT t.table_name 
        FROM information_schema.tables t
        WHERE t.table_schema = DATABASE()
          AND t.table_type = 'BASE TABLE';
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = TRUE;

    OPEN table_cursor;
    
    statistics_loop: LOOP
        FETCH table_cursor INTO table_name;
        IF done THEN
            LEAVE statistics_loop;
        END IF;
        
        SET @sql = CONCAT('ANALYZE TABLE ', table_name);
        PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
        EXECUTE stmt;
        DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
    END LOOP;
    
    CLOSE table_cursor;
END //
DELIMITER ;

-- Schedule regular execution
-- CALL UpdateDatabaseStatistics();
```

### Limiting Result Sets

#### Intent
Reduce memory consumption and processing overhead by fetching only the data required for specific use cases.

#### Effective Filtering Techniques

**1. Use LIMIT with Proper ORDER BY**
```sql
-- INEFFICIENT: Sorting entire table then limiting
SELECT customer_id, name, created_date
FROM customers
ORDER BY created_date DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- EFFICIENT: Use index on created_date
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_created_date ON customers(created_date DESC);

SELECT customer_id, name, created_date
FROM customers
ORDER BY created_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**2. Pagination with OFFSET Optimization**
```sql
-- INEFFICIENT: Large OFFSET values scan many rows
SELECT customer_id, name
FROM customers
ORDER BY customer_id
LIMIT 20 OFFSET 10000;

-- EFFICIENT: Cursor-based pagination
SELECT customer_id, name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id > 10020  -- Last seen ID from previous page
ORDER BY customer_id
LIMIT 20;
```

**3. Conditional Data Retrieval**
```sql
-- Use CASE statements to conditionally include expensive calculations
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    name,
    email,
    CASE 
        WHEN @include_stats = 1 THEN (
            SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE customer_id = c.customer_id
        )
        ELSE NULL
    END as order_count,
    CASE 
        WHEN @include_stats = 1 THEN (
            SELECT SUM(total_amount) FROM orders WHERE customer_id = c.customer_id
        )
        ELSE NULL
    END as total_spent
FROM customers c
WHERE region = 'North America';
```

**4. Filtering with Early Termination**
```sql
-- Use EXISTS to stop processing when condition is met
SELECT DISTINCT c.customer_id, c.name
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o 
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id 
      AND o.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
    LIMIT 1  -- Stop at first match
);
```

## Advanced Performance Techniques

### Query Plan Caching

#### Intent
Leverage prepared statements and plan caching to avoid repeated query compilation overhead.

```sql
-- Prepare frequently used queries
PREPARE customer_orders FROM 
'SELECT c.name, o.order_id, o.total_amount
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_id = ? AND o.order_date >= ?';

-- Execute with parameters
SET @customer_id = 123;
SET @start_date = '2024-01-01';
EXECUTE customer_orders USING @customer_id, @start_date;
```

### Batch Processing

#### Intent
Process large datasets efficiently by breaking operations into manageable chunks.

```sql
-- Batch update example
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE BatchUpdateCustomerStatus()
BEGIN
    DECLARE batch_size INT DEFAULT 1000;
    DECLARE rows_updated INT DEFAULT 0;
    
    update_loop: LOOP
        UPDATE customers 
        SET status = 'inactive'
        WHERE last_login_date < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
          AND status = 'active'
        LIMIT batch_size;
        
        SET rows_updated = ROW_COUNT();
        
        IF rows_updated = 0 THEN
            LEAVE update_loop;
        END IF;
        
        -- Add small delay to prevent lock contention
        SELECT SLEEP(0.1);
    END LOOP;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

### Connection and Resource Management

#### Intent
Optimize database connections and resource utilization for better overall performance.

```sql
-- Monitor connection usage
SHOW PROCESSLIST;

-- Check for long-running queries
SELECT 
    id,
    user,
    host,
    db,
    command,
    time,
    state,
    LEFT(info, 50) as query_start
FROM information_schema.processlist
WHERE time > 30
ORDER BY time DESC;

-- Monitor table locks
SHOW OPEN TABLES WHERE in_use > 0;
```

## Performance Monitoring and Maintenance

### Query Performance Metrics

#### Intent
Establish baseline performance metrics and identify degradation over time.

```sql
-- Enable query logging for performance analysis
-- SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'ON';
-- SET GLOBAL long_query_time = 2;

-- Query to analyze slow query log patterns
SELECT 
    SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(argument, ' ', 3), ' ', -1) as query_type,
    COUNT(*) as occurrence_count,
    AVG(query_time) as avg_execution_time,
    MAX(query_time) as max_execution_time,
    SUM(rows_examined) as total_rows_examined
FROM mysql.slow_log
WHERE start_time >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
GROUP BY query_type
ORDER BY avg_execution_time DESC;
```

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

#### Intent
Implement routine maintenance to prevent performance degradation over time.

```sql
-- Table maintenance script
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE PerformTableMaintenance()
BEGIN
    -- Optimize tables to reclaim space and update statistics
    OPTIMIZE TABLE customers, orders, products, order_items;
    
    -- Update table statistics
    ANALYZE TABLE customers, orders, products, order_items;
    
    -- Check for table corruption
    CHECK TABLE customers, orders, products, order_items;
END //
DELIMITER ;

-- Schedule monthly execution
-- CALL PerformTableMaintenance();
```
