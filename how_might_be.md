*A "How might we..." approach to software design fundamentals*

## üß± OOP Principles ‚Äî "How might we..."

### **Encapsulation**
*How might we hide internal details and only expose what's necessary?*

- How might we ensure a `BankAccount` only changes balance through `Deposit` and `Withdraw`, not direct field access?
- How might we protect sensitive user data while still allowing necessary operations?
- How might we prevent external code from breaking our object's internal consistency?
- How might we create a clean public interface while hiding complex implementation details?

**Example Applications:**
- Private fields with public methods for controlled access
- Property getters/setters with validation logic
- Internal state machines that can't be corrupted externally

### **Abstraction**
*How might we focus on what an object does, not how it does it?*

- How might we define `IContentStorage` so we can swap between file system and cloud storage?
- How might we create a `PaymentProcessor` interface that works with any payment gateway?
- How might we design a `Logger` that could write to files, databases, or external services?
- How might we abstract complex business rules into simple, understandable operations?

**Example Applications:**
- Interface definitions that hide implementation complexity
- Abstract base classes that define contracts
- Service layers that abstract infrastructure concerns

### **Inheritance**
*How might we reuse and extend existing behavior when one object is-a specialized version of another?*

- How might we say `VideoArticle` is a type of `Article` but with extra behavior?
- How might we create specialized user types (`AdminUser`, `PremiumUser`) that inherit common user functionality?
- How might we build a hierarchy of shapes (`Circle`, `Rectangle`) that all share basic shape properties?
- How might we avoid code duplication while maintaining type-specific behavior?

**Example Applications:**
- Base classes with common functionality
- Template method patterns
- Hierarchical domain models

### **Polymorphism**
*How might we allow different objects to be treated the same way, while behaving differently under the hood?*

- How might we render different content types ‚Äî `Article`, `Image`, `Video` ‚Äî all through a `Render()` method?
- How might we process various file formats through a common `Parse()` interface?
- How might we handle different notification types (email, SMS, push) through one `Send()` method?
- How might we enable runtime behavior switching without changing client code?

**Example Applications:**
- Method overriding in inheritance hierarchies
- Interface implementations with different behaviors
- Runtime type resolution and dispatch

## üìê SOLID Principles ‚Äî "How might we..."

### **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
*How might we ensure a class only does one thing well?*

- How might we avoid `Article` also handling persistence ‚Äî instead use `ArticleRepository`?
- How might we separate user authentication from user profile management?
- How might we keep email formatting separate from email sending logic?
- How might we ensure each class has only one reason to change?

**Example Applications:**
- Separate data access objects from business logic
- Distinct validation, formatting, and persistence concerns
- Single-purpose service classes

### **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
*How might we make the system open for extension but closed for modification?*

- How might we add a new workflow status without rewriting core logic?
- How might we support new file formats without changing the existing parser framework?
- How might we add new discount types without modifying the pricing engine?
- How might we use plugins and extensions to add features?

**Example Applications:**
- Strategy pattern implementations
- Plugin architectures
- Abstract factories for extensibility

### **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
*How might we ensure subclasses can replace their parents without breaking the system?*

- How might `PremiumUser` behave correctly anywhere a `User` is expected?
- How might we ensure `ElectricCar` works properly wherever `Car` is used?
- How might we maintain behavioral contracts in inheritance hierarchies?
- How might we avoid strengthening preconditions or weakening postconditions?

**Example Applications:**
- Proper inheritance hierarchies
- Interface compliance verification
- Contract-driven design

### **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
*How might we avoid forcing classes to depend on methods they don't need?*

- How might we design `IReadableContent` and `IWritableContent` separately so read-only users aren't forced to implement `Write`?
- How might we split large interfaces into focused, cohesive ones?
- How might we prevent interface pollution and minimize dependencies?
- How might we create role-based interfaces?

**Example Applications:**
- Small, focused interfaces
- Role-based interface design
- Composition over large monolithic interfaces

### **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
*How might we depend on abstractions instead of concrete classes?*

- How might we let `ContentService` depend on `IStorageProvider` instead of `FileStorage` directly?
- How might we make high-level modules independent of low-level implementation details?
- How might we use dependency injection to improve testability?
- How might we create flexible, loosely-coupled architectures?

**Example Applications:**
- Dependency injection containers
- Abstract service interfaces
- Inversion of control patterns
